# Sensors

There are several major types of sensors in FRC.

| Type | Use | Common Examples | Image |
|:----:|:---:|:---------------:|:-----:|
| Proximity Switch | Detecting objects and their characteristics | Beam breaks, color sensors |  |
| Distance Sensor | Finding how far away an object is from sensor | Ultrasonic sensors, LIDAR | image |
| Shaft Rotation Sensors | Meauring rotational motion, typically of shafts | Encoders | image |
| Accelerometers | Measuring acceleration to track robot position | Triple-axis accelerometer | image |
| Gyroscopes | Measuring rate of rotation to help track robot heading | Three-axis gyro | image |

## Proximity Switches

Proximity switches are one of the most common sensors in FRC. They have many applications, but mainly they are used for detecting objects, like game pieces. These components, like the name suggests, act as "switches": if a criteria is met (detected by the sensor), then they cause an electrical signal. Switches are divided based on how they are activated, each with their own use case. 

### Mechanical Switch (Limit Switch)

Mechanical switches are the simplest type of switch, being activated by a *mechanical* signal. It is akin to a pressure plate, where applying force causes a signal. Although they work in a pinch and are very simple to use, they come with disadvantages. They can be less reliable and may not work for certain applications. In addition, the switch must be activated mechanically which means an object has to directly press on it, which may not work for certain designs and complicate mounting. 

**Mounting**


### Magnetic Switch

### Inductive Switch

### Photoelectric Switch

### Time-of-flight Switch

# Electronics

There are a vast amount of electronics available in FRC. As a designer, it is important to design for these electronics and understand how to mount them.
